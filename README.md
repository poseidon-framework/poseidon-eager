This repository holds all the scripts and resources needed to run the Poseidon Framework's Minotaur Workflow.
The Minotaur workflow takes in sequencing metadata and URLs of publicly archived raw sequencing data (provided
by the community) and processes them in a flexibly configurable yet reproducible manner to produce poseidon
packages. These poseidon packages are then added to the Poseidon Minotaur Archive (PMA), and made available
to everyone through [`trident`](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-hs), the poseidon server-client
infrastructure.
