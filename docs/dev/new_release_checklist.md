<!-- Still preliminary. -->
When a new release is made for minotaur, the following steps should be taken:
- Update the CHANGELOG.md to include a description of all changes.
- Add Release date and bump version number to CHANGELOG.md
- Create new release, release tag, and name.

After the release:
- Update the poseidon-eager release tag used in the [minotaur-recipes repo](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/minotaur-recipes/blob/main/assets/template.config).
